## Introduction 
On April 15, 1912,approximately 113 years ago the RMS Titanic sank during its maiden voyage from Southampton,England to Newyork after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean.
This historical disaster claimed the lives of many, and remains the deadliest maritime tragedies in history.

This project revisits the tragedic event of 1912 through data analysis to uncover common patterns among survivors.

## Problem Statement 
Despite the reported 2,224 passengers she was carrying, survival chances aboard the Titanic were not evenly distributed. Apparently, When the distress call was made factors such as P assenger class, gender, and age appeared to have played a significant role in determining who lived and who perished. 

The Understanding of these disparities is crucial for uncovering the social and structural dynamics that influenced survival during this tragedy. Hence, the aim of this analysis is to investigate how facrors such as passengers class, gender and age on influence survival rate.

## Data Source 

The dataset used for this project is a well-known resource in the data space and is available on Kaggle:  
[Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file)  

It contains information on **1,309 passengers** out of the 2,224 on board the Titanic, excluding crew members.  
This provides a suitable sample size for meaningful analysis of survival patterns across different passenger groups.

The information in each column above represents the following features:

1. **class** — Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; = 3rd)  
2. **survival** — Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)  
3. **name** — Name  
4. **sex** — Sex  
5. **age** — Age  
6. **sibsp** — Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard  
7. **parch** — Number of Parents/Children Aboard  
8. **ticket** — Ticket Number  
9. **fare** — Passenger Fare  
10. **cabin** — Cabin  
11. **embarked** — Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)  
12. **boat** — Lifeboat (if survived)  
13. **body** — Body number (if did not survive and body was recovered)  
14. **home_dest** — Destination
