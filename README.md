## Introduction 
On April 15, 1912,approximately 113 years ago the RMS Titanic sank during its maiden voyage from Southampton,England to Newyork after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean.
This historical disaster claimed the lives of many, and remains the deadliest maritime tragedies in history.

This project revisits the tragedic event of 1912 through data analysis to uncover common patterns among survivors.

## Problem Statement 
Despite the reported 2,224 passengers she was carrying, survival chances aboard the Titanic were not evenly distributed. Apparently, When the distress call was made factors such as P assenger class, gender, and age appeared to have played a significant role in determining who lived and who perished. 

The Understanding of these disparities is crucial for uncovering the social and structural dynamics that influenced survival during this tragedy. Hence, the aim of this analysis is to investigate how facrors such as passengers class, gender and age on influence survival rate.
