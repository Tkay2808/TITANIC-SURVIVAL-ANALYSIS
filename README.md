## Introduction 
On April 15, 1912,approximately 113 years ago the RMS Titanic sank during its maiden voyage from Southampton,England to Newyork after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean.
This historical disaster claimed the lives of many, and remains the deadliest maritime tragedies in history.

This project revisits the tragedic event of 1912 through data analysis to uncover common patterns among survivors.

---
## Problem Statement 
Despite the reported 2,224 passengers she was carrying, survival chances aboard the Titanic were not evenly distributed. Apparently, When the distress call was made factors such as P assenger class, gender, and age appeared to have played a significant role in determining who lived and who perished. 

The Understanding of these disparities is crucial for uncovering the social and structural dynamics that influenced survival during this tragedy. Hence, the aim of this analysis is to investigate how factors such as passengers class, gender and age influence survival rate.

## Data Source 

The dataset used for this project is a well-known resource in the data space and is available on Kaggle:  
[Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file)  

It contains information on **1,309 passengers** out of the 2,224 on board the Titanic, excluding crew members.  
This provides a suitable sample size for meaningful analysis of survival patterns across different passenger groups.

## Raw Data 

The downloaded dataset was imported into Microsoft Excel and opened in its raw form as shown below with 14 columns of raw passenger information requiring cleaning for further analysis.

The information in each column above has the following features:

1. **pclass** — Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; = 3rd)  
2. **survived** — Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)  
3. **name** — Name  
4. **sex** — Sex  ( Male or Female)
5. **age** — Age  
6. **sibsp** — Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard  
7. **parch** — Number of Parents/Children Aboard  
8. **ticket** — Ticket Number  
9. **fare** — Passenger Fare  
10. **cabin** — Cabin  
11. **embarked** — Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)  
12. **boat** — Lifeboat (if survived)  
13. **body** — Body number (if did not survive and body was recovered)  
14. **home_dest** — Destination

## Data Cleaning Process 

The Titanic dataset required several cleaning steps to prepare it for analysis. Below is the structured **step-by-step process**:  

1. **Initial Inspection**  
   - Applied filters on each column to understand the dataset and identify issues.  

2. **Column Renaming & Replacements**  
   - Renamed **Passenger Class** column → *1st, 2nd, 3rd class*.  
   - Replaced **Survival Status** codes → *1 = Survived, 0 = Victim*.  

3. **Name Standardization**  
   - Split the *Name* column into *Title, First Name, Last Name* (using *Text-to-Columns*).  
   - Reconstructed the full name using the *CONCAT/CONCATENATE* function.  

4. **Gender Standardization**  
   - Converted all values in the *Sex* column to **Proper Case** (e.g., *male → Male*, *female → Female*).  

5. **Handling Missing Ages**  
   - Found **263 missing ages** out of 1,309 records (~20%).  
   - Since missing values were < 30%, imputed them using the **Median Age = 28**.  
   - Median was chosen as it is resistant to outliers. 
   - created the age- group column,to categories the ages of passengers using the IF function to assign each passenger to an age group.
   - (0 - 16= Children,17 - 33 = Youths,34 - 50 = Adults,51 -64 = Middle Aged,65+ = Elderlys)

6. **Family Size Feature Creation**  
   - Created a new **Family Members** column by adding:  
     `sibsp + parch`.  

7. **Ticket Column**  
   - Dropped the *Ticket Number* column as it was not relevant for analysis.  

8. **Fare Column**  
   - Rounded fares to the nearest whole number and added currency (euros).  
   - Note: Historical reference suggests **3rd class tickets cost ~3–8 euros** in 1912.  
   - Passengers with **0 fare** were assumed to have boarded illegally or under special cases.  

9. **Cabin Column**  
   - Dropped the *Cabin* column since **1,014 cells (~77%)** were empty.  

10. **Boat & Body Columns**  
    - Deleted both columns since missing values were > 70% and not relevant to the analysis.  

11. **Embarked Column**  
    - Renamed column to **Port Embarked From**.  
    - Replaced codes with full names:  
      - **S → Southampton**  
      - **C → Cherbourg**  
      - **Q → Queenstown**

After general cleaning the dataset became **structured, consistent, and ready for further analysis.** to draw insight and identify patterns

## Analysis and Calculations

Pivot tables and charts where used for analysis and calculations of KPI's and other metrics like

   - Survivors by Passenger Class

   - Survivors by Gender

   - Survivors by Age group

## KPI's 

![Image preview](KPI's.jpg) 

- A total of **1,309 passengers** were onboard the Titanic.  
- The **survival rate was 38%**, meaning just over one-third of passengers survived.  
- The **death rate was 68%**, indicating that more than two-thirds of passengers perished, highlighting the tragedy’s scale.  
- The **average passenger age was 30 years**, suggesting that most onboard were relatively young adults.  

- #### The KPI's reflect the severity of the disaster, with a low survival ratio as compared to the death ratio and predominantly young passengers on board.

## Insights 

![image preview](Survivors_class.png)

### 1. Survivors by Class  
- **First Class:** First class passengers go had the best survival outcomes (**200 survived vs 123 perished**) due to proximity to lifeboats and quicker access to the deck.  

- **Second Class:** Mixed results (**119 survived vs 158 perished**) reflecting their intermediate position onboard.  
- **Third Class:** The 3rd class passengers were the most disadvantaged (**528 deaths vs 181 survivors**).lower-deck locations, and class divisions critically reduced their chances survival.

### 2. Survivors by Gender  
- **Females:** Significantly had higher survival rate (**339 survived vs 127 perished**) due to the "women and children first" policy.  
- **Males:** Disproportionately affected (**682 deaths vs 161 survivors**), making up the majority of victims.

![image preview](Survivors_age.jpg)

### 3. Survivors by Age Group  
- **Youths (17–33 years):*** The youths were the largest group onboard but also had the highest number of deaths (**532 victims vs 280 survivors**). Being young did not guarantee survival,and likely due to limited access to lifeboats.  

- **Children (0–16 years):** Higher survival chance (**74 survived vs 60 perished**), suggesting they were prioritized during evacuation.  

- **Elderly (65+ years):** Most vulnerable, with only **2 survivors** compared to **11 deaths**, reflecting physical limitations in the chaos.

 #### Summary   
The Titanic disaster starkly revealed how **age, gender, and social class shaped survival chances**.  

- Women and children were prioritized, especially in higher classes.  
- Men, particularly young men in third class, bore the greatest losses.  
- First-class passengers benefitted from privilege and proximity, while third-class passengers suffered from both **physical barriers** and **social inequalities**.  

*This tragedy is not just statistics — it reflects the harsh reality of structural inequality in a life-and-death situation*

---
## Conclusion

The analysis of the Titanic dataset highlights how survival was **unevenly distributed across age, gender, and class**.
  
- **Women and children**, particularly those in higher classes, had the highest chances of survival. 
 
- **Men**, especially those from third class, faced overwhelming losses.  
- **Class privilege** and **physical access to lifeboats** played a decisive role in determining life or death outcomes.  

- Overall, the tragedy reflects how **social structures and inequalities** directly influenced survival during the disaster, turning a maritime accident into a profound lesson on human vulnerability and privilege.

## Limitation 

While this analysis offers key insights, it is important to recognize certain limitations: 
 
1. **Incomplete Data** – The dataset covers only **1,309 passengers out of 2,224**, excluding crew members, which limits the completeness of the analysis.  

2. The analysis only covers Class,gender and Age,other metrics such as Fare,family size was not covered,which could also has an effect on survivors.
   
3. **Contextual Gaps** – Statistical findings cannot fully capture the emotional, cultural, or situational factors that shaped individual survival.
